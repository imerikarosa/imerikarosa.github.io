      Hello! I’m <strong>Erika Pita</strong>, a passionate IT enthusiast currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at <strong>FIU</strong>. My journey in tech started with a simple curiosity about <em>how things work</em>, and it quickly grew into a deep love for <strong>building</strong>, <strong>problem-solving</strong>, and <strong>learning</strong>.

    <p>
      I’m driven by the excitement of <strong>turning ideas into reality</strong> and the <em>endless possibilities</em> that technology offers. I’m always eager to dive into new challenges, learn about the latest advancements, and apply my knowledge in practical ways.
