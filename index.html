      This project was my first experience building a custom PC from the ground up. I thoughtfully selected each component to create a well-balanced and efficient system that meets my needs. This build was a hands-on opportunity to deepen my understanding of <strong>hardware</strong> and the <strong>assembly process</strong>.
